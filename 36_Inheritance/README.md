# Python Inheritance Example

This example demonstrates the concept of inheritance in Python using dataclasses. The code shows a hierarchy of classes:

1. `Employee` - Base class with basic employee attributes
2. `EmployeePost` - Inherits from Employee and adds post information
3. `EmployeeProgrammingLanguage` - Inherits from EmployeePost and adds programming language

Each class extends the functionality of its parent class while maintaining the core employee information.

## Usage
Run `main.py` to see the inheritance examples in action.
