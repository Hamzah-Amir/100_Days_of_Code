# Tuples in Python

This directory demonstrates the use of tuples, immutable sequences in Python.

## Key Concepts

### Tuples
- Immutable sequences
- Created using parentheses `()`
- Can contain mixed data types
- Faster than lists for read-only operations

### Key Features
1. **Immutability**
   - Cannot be modified after creation
   - Elements cannot be added or removed
   - Values cannot be changed

2. **Packing and Unpacking**
   - Multiple values in one tuple
   - Unpack into multiple variables
   - Useful for function returns

3. **Tuple Methods**
   - `count()`: Count occurrences
   - `index()`: Find position
   - Limited compared to lists

### Best Practices
- Use for data that shouldn't change
- Great for function returns
- Use for dictionary keys
- Consider performance benefits

## Code Example
The `main.py` file demonstrates:
- Basic tuple creation and access
- Tuple packing and unpacking
- Tuple methods usage
- Common tuple operations
