# Useful Methods in Python

This script demonstrates three essential Python methods that help in understanding and working with objects and data structures.

## Features

### 1. `dir()` Method
- Shows all available methods and attributes of a dictionary object
- Demonstrates how to use `__dir__()` to explore object capabilities
- Useful for discovering what operations can be performed on an object

### 2. `dict()` Method
- Uses the `__dict__` attribute to convert class attributes to a dictionary
- Demonstrates with a `@dataclass` decorated class
- Shows how class information can be represented as key-value pairs

### 3. `help()` Method
- Provides built-in documentation for Python objects
- Acts as a quick reference without needing to browse external documentation
- Shows detailed information about methods, attributes, and usage

## Usage

Run the script and choose one of the following options:
- `dir` - Explore dictionary methods
- `dict` - See class attributes as dictionary
- `help` - Get help documentation for objects

## Example Output

The script includes interactive input handling with error management and provides clear demonstrations of each method's functionality.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding object introspection in Python
- Learning how to explore object capabilities
- Using built-in help system for documentation
- Working with class attributes and data structures
