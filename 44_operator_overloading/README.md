# Operator Overloading Example: Vector Addition

This program demonstrates operator overloading in Python using a simple `Vector` class.

## What it does
- Defines a `Vector` class with three components (i, j, k) using `@dataclass`.
- Implements the `__add__` method to allow adding two vectors with the `+` operator.
- Shows how to print vectors and their sum in a readable format.

## Example Output
```
Vector 1: 5i + 6k + 7k
vector 2: 8i + 9k + 10k
Resultant vector: 13i + 15k + 17k
<class '__main__.Vector'>
```

## How to run
```sh
python main.py
```
