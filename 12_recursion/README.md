# Recursion in Python

This directory demonstrates the concept of recursion and its implementation in Python.

## Key Concepts

### Recursion
- Function calling itself
- Requires base case to stop
- Breaks problem into smaller parts
- Can be memory intensive

### Key Components
1. **Base Case**
   - Simplest form of the problem
   - Stops the recursion
   - Prevents infinite loops

2. **Recursive Case**
   - Breaks problem into smaller parts
   - Calls function with smaller input
   - Moves toward base case

### Common Applications
- Factorial calculation
- Fibonacci sequence
- Tree traversals
- Sorting algorithms

### Best Practices
- Always have a base case
- Ensure progress toward base case
- Consider stack overflow
- Use for naturally recursive problems

## Code Example
The `main.py` file demonstrates:
- Factorial calculation
- Fibonacci sequence
- Sum of numbers
- Basic recursive patterns
