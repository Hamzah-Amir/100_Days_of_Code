# Loops in Python

This directory demonstrates different types of loops and their usage in Python.

## Key Concepts

### For Loops
- Used when you know the number of iterations
- Can iterate over:
  - Lists, tuples, strings
  - Range of numbers
  - Dictionaries
  - Any iterable object

### While Loops
- Used when you don't know the number of iterations
- Continues as long as condition is True
- Common uses:
  - User input validation
  - Game loops
  - Processing until condition met

### Loop Control Statements
- `break`: Exit the loop
- `continue`: Skip to next iteration
- `else`: Execute when loop completes normally

## Code Examples
The directory contains two files:
1. `for_loops.py`:
   - Basic for loop with lists
   - Range-based iteration
   - Enumerate usage
   - Nested loops
   - Dictionary iteration

2. `while_loops.py`:
   - Basic while loop
   - Break statement
   - Continue statement
   - User input loop
   - List iteration
