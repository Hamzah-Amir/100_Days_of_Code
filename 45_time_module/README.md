# Time Module Demo

This project demonstrates the usage of Python's built-in `time` module through various examples in `main.py`.

## Features

- **Timing Code Execution:**
  - Measures and compares the execution time of a `for` loop and a `while` loop that both count to 5000.
- **Getting Local Time:**
  - Retrieves and prints the current local time using `time.localtime()`.
- **Pausing Execution:**
  - Demonstrates how to pause the program for a specified number of seconds using `time.sleep()`.
- **Formatting Time:**
  - Shows how to format the current time into a readable string using `time.strftime()`.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Output Example

- Prints the time taken by both the `for` and `while` loops.
- Displays the current local time as a struct.
- Waits for 4 seconds before printing the next line.
- Prints the formatted current time (e.g., `24-06-11-15-30-45`).

## Purpose

This script is useful for learning how to:
- Measure code performance
- Work with and format dates and times
- Pause execution in Python scripts
